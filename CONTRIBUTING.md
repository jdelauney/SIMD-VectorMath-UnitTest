## How do I make a contribution?

Here's a quick rundown !

**1.**Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
**2.**Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository 
  under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.
**3.**Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
**4.**Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
**5.**Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
**6.**Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of 
  the project, also known as the index.
**7.**Use git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here" to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
**8.**Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
**9.**Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
- **A).** Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- ** B). **Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. 
For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".  
- **C).** In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made to the interface, this includes new environment, variables, useful file locations, container parameters... Any issues you think exist with the pull request you made and any questions you have for the maintainer. 
It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you  fix any problems and improve it!
- ** D).** You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

**11.**Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
**12.**Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
**13.**Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
