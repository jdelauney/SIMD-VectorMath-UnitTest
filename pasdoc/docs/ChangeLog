2005-11-26 v0.10.0

  + New command-line options:
    --auto-link
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/AutoLinkOption])
    --implicit-visibility
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ImplicitVisibilityOption])
    --no-macro
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/NoMacroOption])
  + New @-tags:
    @bold and @italic
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/BoldAndItalicTags])
    @seealso
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SeeAlsoTag])
    @inheritedClass
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/InheritedClassnameNameTag])
    @preformatted (by Ascanio Pressato)
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/PreformattedTag])
    @orderedList, @unorderedList, @definitionList,
      @item, @itemLabel, @itemSpacing, @itemSetNumber
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ListTags])
    @table, @row, @rowHead, @cell
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/TableTags])
    @noAutoLinkHere, @noAutoLink
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/AutoLinkOption])
    @tableOfContents
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/TableOfContentsTag])
  * Dashes rules: em-dash, en-dash, short dash, "@-"
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/WritingDocumentation])
  * FPC macros are now correctly parsed by pasdoc.
  * Each detailed description in HTML output is enclosed within gray frame
  * Various fixes. E.g.
    * --spell-check-ignore-words works now.
    * @links to @anchors and @sections work always now.
  * Many improvements to pasdoc_gui (by Richard B. Winston and Michalis)
  * back-comments
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/WhereToPlaceComments#head-7ce7157fefbd0d84d3577aa636f758baa813e201])

  Some compatibility had to be broken:
  * New dashes rules break compatibility. But actually previous
    behavior with regards to dashes was broken, because "-"
    was just always directly copied to output. So previously
    in HTML "-" always meant just a short dash (there was no
    way to write en-dash or em-dash). And in LaTeX
    "---"/"--"/"-" meant em-dash/en-dash/short dash,
    but there was no way to escape it (i.e. there was no "@-"
    construct).
  * Back-comments feature breaks compatibility if you have comments
    that have as their exact 1st character "<". Now they will be
    interpreted as back-comments (assigned to previous item
    with "<" stripped). To fix your docs, just add
    a space inside such problematic comment right before "<".

  done by Michalis Kamburelis.

2005-07-09 v0.9.0

  End-user visible changes:
  + New command-line options:

    --introduction and --conclusion
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/IntroductionAndConclusion])
    --latex-head
      (see appropriate part of [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CommandLine])
    --link-gv-uses and --link-gv-classes
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/GraphVizSupport])
    --link-look
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LinkLookOption])
    --sort
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SortOption])
    --use-tipue-search
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/UseTipueSearchOption])
    --version
      (see appropriate part of [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CommandLine])
  + New @-tags:
    @br
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/BrTag])
    @latex
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LatexTag])
    @section, @anchor, @title, @shorttitle tags in introduction/conclusion
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/IntroductionAndConclusion])
    @deprecated
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/DeprecatedTag])
    @value and @member
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/MemberValueTag])
  + pasdoc_gui, a GUI alternative to console pasdoc version.
  + Spell checking (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SpellChecking])
  * Cache is now independent from output format
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CacheOption])
  * Many fixes and improvements to HTML output,
    it's now structured a little more consistently,
    it's more configurable by CSS,
    it's 100% conforming HTML 4.01 Transitional.
  * Many fixes and improvements to LaTeX output,
    it's also structured more consistently,
    and it doesn't omit undocumented items
    (see the bottom of [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/WritingDocumentation]).
  * @longcode improvements:
    it's now formatted in LaTeX output,
    the look of float and hex values inside @longcode in HTML output
    is configurable by CSS.
  * Parsing improvements:
    * Better full declaration of items is now displayed in documentation
    * FPC overloaded operators are now parsed
    * Delphi hint directives (deprecated, platform, library) are now parsed
  * You don't have to enclose tag parameters in parenthesis
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/TagsParametersWithoutParenthesis])
  * Many many other small fixes and improvements.

  Many internal improvements, like:
  + We maintain a large set of tests (regression tests,
    conformance tests etc.) in pasdoc sources
    (see tests/README file in pasdoc sources and
    [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/RegressionTesting]).

  Documentation:
    You can find the most complete and up-to-date documentation
    of pasdoc features in our wiki, [http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/].
    Unfortunately, with pasdoc 0.9.0, offline documentation
    (previously in docs/ directory of released archives) is no longer
    provided, this is intended to be fixed in future releases
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ToDoOfflineDocs]).

  Some compatibility had to be broken:
  * pasdoc.css will be always overwritten when you generate HTML documentation.
    You must use --css command-line option
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CssOption])
    if you want to use your custom css.
  * By default no items are sorted.
    You must use --sort command-line option
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SortOption])
    if you want to change this.
  * @links look now a little different, see
    [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LinkLookOption] and
    [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LinkTag],
    use --link-look=stripped if you really need old behavior.

  Authors: many. See @author tags at the beginning of pasdoc 0.9.0 units.

2004-07-12 v0.8.8.1 to v0.8.8.3 Johannes Berg, others
 + applied a bunch of patches that were floating around on the mailing list
 + some code cleanup

2004-05-06 v0.8.8 Johannes Berg, Richard B Winston, Carl Eric Codere
 + fix a lot of tiny bugs, range check errors, etc
 + implement consolidation for // style comments so that you can now
   use // style comments in multiple lines like this:
   // @abstract(something)
   // and a real comment
   and both lines will be added to the documentation.
 + @longcode tag implemented (fixes bug #802469)
 + \LaTeX output

2003-11-20 v0.8.8-pre6 Johannes Berg
 + fix 3 logged bugs
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-842325 ] bug in function IsMacro
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-844324 ] tag "returns" very together does not insert a jump of line
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-844325 ] The tag "return" does not work, "returns" with "s" if
 + corrected output of @raises tag (last character could be cut off)
 + javi fixed and updated the Spanish translation
 + added proper warning for FPC operator overloading as it is not supported
   right now. TODO item: write a ParseOperator function
 + added support for FreePascal inline "calling convention"

2003-08-04 v0.8.8-pre5 Johannes Berg
 * more CSS, completely new style

2003-05-14 v0.8.8-pre4 Thomas Mueller
 + more CSS
 + code cleanup
 + if class has no description, write ancestor's description and
   a warning
 + reordering by visibility
 + @param, @returns, @raises except argument in parentheses now

2003-05-09 v0.8.8-pre3 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + write complete known hierarchy in class descriptions
 - remove calling hhc.exe, you should do this from a script
 + fixed HTML-Help output
 + fixed numeric name creation wrt. cross-links
   (there was a rather BAD bug, now all numbers are
    sequential too!)
 + automatically turn on numeric filenames for HTML help because
   hhc chokes on extra dots in filenames
 + bugfix: "~" is a valid character in a URL

2003-05-02 v0.8.8-pre2 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + better HTML output with CSS
 + HTML output has new section links
 + fix hierarchy: objects descend from TObject,
   interfaces with GUID are now shown properly

2003-05-01 v0.8.8-pre1 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + hierarchy is shown properly with everything
 + name directive for imported functions parsed properly
 + proper HTML entity encoding

2003-04-20 v0.8.7 Johannes Berg/Thomas Mueller
Based on Ralf Junker's changes, I did the following:
 + added enumerated type parsing
 + made work with FPC
 + records (handled like classes),
   + case statements in records
   + nested records
 + spell-checker for linux (currently disabled, use an older CVS file
   of RunHelp to use under Kylix, will not work in FPC, need advice)
 + new option-parser
 + uses delphi streams instead of files. Supposedly does not work
   on all platforms FPC runs on - need advice
 + commentmarker (for example only {: comments )
 + declarations like
   "var a: function(x,y,z:Integer):Integer cdecl = nil"
   are parsed correctly
 + dependency plotting with GraphViz (AT&T )
   (not very useful)
 + uses clause will be included in doc (optional)
 + links "http://", "ftp://" etc. are recognized automatically
 + varargs directive
 + abbreviations "@author(johannes)" can be expanded
   to @author(Johannes Berg <...>) via abbreviatons file
 + @cvs($Date ...$), @cvs($Author ...$) is recognized and
   used for lastmod / author
   + duplicate authors skipped
 - name search doesn't look into classes any more,
   if a method reference is needed outside the current class
   then the class has to be specified:
   @link(class.method)
   (faster and less error-prone)
 + HTML output uses unitname.classname.html instead of numbers,
   but has option to make number-only-filenames (for short-name
   filesystems)
 + class member visibility can be specified in output
 + long option names (see PasDoc --help)
 + images are no longer carried in a .RES file but in include
   files instead, as constants in code, for FPC

Some time inbetween... (0.6.21 to 0.8.6) Ralf Junker
 - LaTeX documentation removed
 - see http://zeitungsjunge.de/delphi/PasDoc/History.htm for
   more information.

2000/04/20 v0.6.20 ms
- added Rodrigo Jardim's translations of pasdoc's output to Brasilian
  Portuguese; new switch -b (and --brasilian)
- increased STEP from 32 to 128 when reallocating description pointers,
  this makes pasdoc crash less with RTE 216; bug must still be fixed by
  changing GetMem's default behaviour

2000/04/17 v0.6.19 ms
- fixed bug that prevented pasdoc from skipping code until an $else
  conditional directive (thanks to Michael v. Canneyt for reporting

  creates Dutch output
- successfully created docs on Delphi 5 rtl\win directory (222 seconds, 16 MB html
  files on a P-II 350, 256 MB RAM)

  subsection nesting of LaTeX output)
- moved LoadDescriptionFile and LoadDescriptionFiles from main.TPasdoc to
  gendoc.TDocGenerator
- worked on external description file loading
- email addresses in author tags are now displayed as mailto links in HTML
  output
- hard-coded HTML colors in body element (already added colors for tables
  etc., as long as the whole thing is not CSS-based, it's better to have
  all colors defined so that unusual default colors of a browser won't ruin
  the overall impression)
- released 0.6.15

2000/04/08 v0.6.13 ms
- released 0.6.13

2000/04/06 v0.6.13 ms

  I am unable to trace; Delphi 5 compiles pasdoc without problems but crashes when
  running it on appinfo.pas between the second and third constant for no apparent
  reason; I will try to fix bugs that are more obvious in the near future...
- fixed bug that made default keyword after a property appear as a field of that class
  (thanks to Andre Jager for pointing this out)
- fixed bug that made pasdoc crash on an empty author tag: @author()
  (thanks to Michael Hess for finding and isolating (!) this!)
- made pasdoc skip property declaration; property parsing needs some work,
  I will do this soon

2000/04/03 v0.6.11 ms
- created sourceforge.net account; pasdoc is now at http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net
- modified homepage to have frames; single page has become too huge

2000/03/31 v0.6.11 ms

  science - woohooo! again some time to work on pasdoc...

2000/02/11 v0.6.10 ms
- changed directory structure of the pasdoc project (added src, bin, man etc.)

  react on them with an error message
- received pasdoc DOS binaries sent in by Jean-Pierre Vial and created a 0.6.9
  DOS binaries release, then updated the homepage
- added IOResult check in TFileInputStream.Open in filestre.pas; no more crashing
  on non-existent files
